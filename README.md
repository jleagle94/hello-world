# hello-world
This is my second git-hub repository. Technically, it's my first ever but my aws_projects and others have been given way more love. I will now use my hello-world repository for my Radiative Processes course (ASTR8100). I will rename this repository to reflect this. It is now called "astr_project" 

On 11/8/19 I revisited to recall how to do a pull request before submitting for Homework 30 in ASTR 8100. Now I just want the professor to see the pull request is secure and ready to be merged.
